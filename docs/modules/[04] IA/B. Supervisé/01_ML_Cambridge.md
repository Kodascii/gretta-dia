## Keywords
- <def-of>PDF</def-of> : In case of a continuous random variable the assignment of probabilities results in a *probability density function*
- <def-of>PMF</def-of> : If the random variable is discrete, i.e., it takes on a finite number of values, then the assignment of probabilities is called a probability mass function
- <def-of>Online learning</def-of> : Learning paradigm where a model is updated continuously as new data becomes available, rather than being trained on a fixed dataset in a batch manner.
